<span style="font-size: 300%;">Consolidation 1</span>

My win is making the site map on GeoJson. Although it was the first building block to the map making module it allowed me to explore both my data, and Jupyter lab. For the consolidation week I returned to the graveyard to recollect the data with the proper coordinates and submit it into my revised form. Remaking the map was much easier than the second time. I also used my second trip to the graveyard to collect more images to be used for the 3D models of the graves. This process was the first time I felt genuinely engaged in public archaeology as discussed by Elizabeth Bollwerk in Co-Creation’s Role in

Digital Public Archaeology in week 1. I can imagine how these tools might be used by a team, or within a community in the fourth stage of co-creating. In an annotation Athena Mosley asks how we might reconsider our systems as a tool for archaeologists to use while being led by Indigenous and descendant communities. I think the tools I utilized this week would be suitable for this kind of arrangement. The user-friendly nature of these tools would make them effective in both collecting information through public means and displaying the information widely. It makes a great deal of sense that methods of “slow archaeology” have fallen to the wayside in some cases. Of course, there is something to be said of the skilled crafts that make slow archeology possible but from the viewpoint of data being public property, these digital tools are incredibly valuable. 

I have also found that the discord is very helpful. I only asked a few questions but reading through other people’s discussions has helped me understand the work. 

My fail would be my first time going to record the gravestones. I went to a graveyard that did not have many historical gravestones. I also did not inquire about permission to record the stones, so I was unable to take information down anyways as I think that would be unethical. This did guide me to understand the importance of research before going to a site, and how essential it is to seek permission to enter a space to record data. The ethics of digital archaeology as discussed in Getting It Right and Getting It Wrong in Digital Archaeological Ethics by L. Meghan Dennis guided me in these decisions. It is discussed that although digital tools are (often) much faster and can be more thorough in collecting data, one must weigh the pros and cons of each option. In my case I presumably had the option to enter the public graveyard and gather information with my phone discretely, rather than bringing in analog equipment. In that case I chose not the gather data. I found the Alex Jane’s question left on the reading interesting. They ask if technology could be designed with ethical considerations in the method. This was interesting to me as I had never considered this. Technology is often regarded as a neutral player and humans as partisan operators. I think this is untrue in many ways. The essence of data collection method does come from a place of extraction, and I think that is essential to address. 
 
 In general, I have found the workflow required for this class is very challenging to me. The asynchronous style usually leaves me confused and, for lack of a better term, flailing. I tend to prefer classes with more conventional teaching strategies. Usually, I enter classes with the expectation that I know how to use the learning materials. Trying to use Jupyter properly has added a level of complication for me. I missed my notes in week three, it was an extremely busy week for me. I’m a fourth-year journalism student so my work requires me to be in a lot of places and available for interviews at any time, last week got away from me. I completed the readings and found them interesting, but between that and struggling through the tasks I didn’t reasonably have time to slow myself down by fumbling with the note system. 

In the coming weeks I hope to spend more time with the technical aspects of the class. I also hope to engage with the readings on a deeper level and begin drawing links between them and more of our tasks.
